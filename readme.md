Canvas Particle Triangle 3D Rotation Animation
This project demonstrates how to create a simple 3D rotation animation of a triangle composed of particles using JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas element.

Introduction
In this project, we utilize the HTML5 Canvas element to create a dynamic animation where particles form a triangle and rotate in a 3D manner. The animation is achieved by updating the position of individual particles and redrawing the Canvas repeatedly.

Features
Dynamic generation of particles forming a triangle.
3D rotation animation effect.
Random color generation for particles.
